From it you may easily read out the service name, corresponding thing, and corresponding hub (this needs to be identified through the color).

Inputs to invoke the service are collect from `inports` at the left side while the outputs from the service locates at the right side and called as `outports`.

A service may have one to many `inports` and `outports`. An output of a service X could be the input of another service Y - this could be modelled by connecting the related inports and outports of X and Y, with a line, as illstrated by the steps shown in the following.
