# Service Type

In the IoT SOL, we can easily convert every features/functions/executable-binaries into services, and the services can come from IoT Device, Gateway, PC or Cloud. 

There are two methods: 

* create/edit via the Web IDE, you can see the [add service:abs](#getstarted/example/add_service) for details
* directly create/edit the service/thing folders in thingbundle.

The basic concept and rules of editing/creating services are listed in [Edit Service](#getstarted/advanced/edit_service)

As a service of IoT SOL, it can

* directly control the peripheral or process in JavaScript.
* invoke a exsiting exectuable binary.
* access the cloud services by restful API, socket, ...
