# Edit Service

## Introduction

You can create your own service or edit exsiting service in IoT SOL.

There are two methods: 

* Through Web IDE, you can see the `example -> add service:abs` for details. Basically, you may edit the service (either existing or newly created) by clicking the `</>` icon in the left sidebar.

* Offline by directly going to the folders on disk where store the services/things.

The second way is more advanced and developers should be very careful and have enough knowledge about the directory layout and related APIs. Please carefully read [this](#getstarted/advanced/edit_service/2-service) for details.

Furthermore, if it is created in the second way, as it is done offline, so need to restart related Hub (that hosts this changed thing/service) to reload them.
