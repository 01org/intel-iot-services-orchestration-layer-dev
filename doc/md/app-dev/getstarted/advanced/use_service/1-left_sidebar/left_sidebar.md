# Service on Left Sidebar

All available services are listed in the left sidebar when edit the workflows. As illustrated below, it's organized in 3-level hierarchy - top level as **Hubs**, and 2nd level as **Things** under these **Hubs**, and the last level as **Services** under **Things**.

One may quickly find by **Service** by typing a substring related to the Service in the search bar at the top. The search could be cancelled by pressing the ESC in keyboard.

The **Services** is draggable from left sidebar and could be dropped to the canvas on the right side to form the workflows.

Some **Services** are editable, and click the `</>` adjacent to it would enter the edit user interface. And you may see [Edit Service](#getstarted/advanced/edit_service) for more details and  [add service:abs](#getstarted/example/add_service) for an example.

The **Service** may have help. Move mouse over it for a while, a small dialog may prompt to show some description about that, and if there is an icon on the top right corner, you may click it access more detailed help, as illustrated below.
